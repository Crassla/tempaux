        <h3 class="content_text" style="font-size:1.vw;">With more than twenty years experience in helping businesses
            sort out their accounting processes and systems, I take care of the "books" so you can focus on your
            business.<br><br>

            I process your accounting transactions to a final Trial Balance stage, ready for your accountant to review
            each month.<br><br>

            As part of this service I ensure your systems and processes are both well planned and robust, so you can be
            confident in the timeliness and accuracy of the financial information produced<br><br>
        </h3>
        <h3 style="font-size:1.5vw;">Hourly Rate</h3>
        <h3 class="content_text" style="font-size:1.vw;">My hourly rate is $50 plus GST, although I tailor my fee based
            upon the type and complexity of work undertaken, as well as taking consideration of what your specific
            requirements are.

        <h3 style="font-size:1.5vw;">Contract Accounting Services</h3>
        <h3 class="content_text" style="font-size:1.vw;"><b>Bookkeeping service:</b><br>

            Once a week I will enter all accounting transactions for you into your accounting system. This includes
            cheques, deposits, and other transactions affecting the bank accounts. It also includes estimates, invoices,
            credit memos, and all customer transactions. It includes supplier transactions: bills, item receipts,
            checks, credit card charges, and purchase orders.<br><br>

            I will perform the bank reconciliation for all bank accounts. I will also enter adjusting journal entries as
            necessary, including depreciation. I will set up new customers, employees, and suppliers on an as needed
            basis. All of the above transactions will be entered from original documents and ledgers you
            provide.<br><br>

            On a monthly basis, I can prepare payroll for your employees, including the monthly PAYE forms for your
            approval. I will also prepare the GST returns for your approval as it falls due.<br><br>

            <b>System set up:</b><br>
            In the situation where your accounting system is not yet set up for data entry, or you need your system set
            up more effectively, I will create the data file for your business.<br><br>

            I will record the beginning account balances from a Balance Sheet you provide. I will set up your
            preferences and user IDs to reflect your current accounting requirements. I will enter company, customer,
            supplier, and employee data from information you provide to me. As required I will enter sales items and GST
            details based on information you provide us. If applicable, I will enter stock items and quantities on hand
            as provided by you.<br><br>
